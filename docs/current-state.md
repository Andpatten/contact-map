### Summary of Current State

Currently the app is able to retrieve the contact list from android and return a list of contacts 
that is sorted by proximity and within the desired range. The contacts are also able to be edited 
from the UI from the app by clicking on them. The app does not have any persistent data. The persistent
data that will be stored in later versions will include past queries. There are also a number of details
that have not yet been added such as a visual of all contacts in a certain range on a map and more sorting
/filtering options. Javadocs have not been finished. Some incorporated licenses need to be added. Settings have 
yet to be added. These features will continue to trickle in as development continues.
